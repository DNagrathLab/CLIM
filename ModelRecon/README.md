# Input
Recon22.xml: SBML model for for Human Genome Scale Model Recon 2.2

mRNA_Clus19p13_OV: log-transformed gene expression data for the average TCGA ovarian cancer model and the 4 clusters with 19p13 loss. Values can be transformed to act as input to most model reconstruction algorithms

# Output
SBML-compatible reconstructed models for the average TCGA ovarian cancer model and the average expression of tumors in 4 clusters with 19p13 loss. These can be exported to xml files or directly used in MATLAB's implementation of the COBRA toolbox.
